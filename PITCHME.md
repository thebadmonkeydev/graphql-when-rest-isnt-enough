# GraphQL
### When REST isn't enough

### When REST isn't enough?

- Incomplete data sets
- Multiple network requests for a full data context
- Wasted bandwidth when the client needs a small data set

---

## Enter GraphQL
- What it is
  - Rapid client development
  - API evolution

@fa[angle-down]

+++

- Type system
  - Define-it-and-forget-it
  - Strongly typed
  - Clean layer of abstraction

---

## GraphQL vs. REST
- REST is:
  - Well known and intrinsic in Rails
  - Simpler with lower switching costs
  - Complex for production-scale applications
  - Ad-hoc and often internally motivated abstraction
- GraphQL is:
  - Client-driven

---

## Should you adopt GraphQL?
- They have more than one client application
- A mobile client/focus on latency and bandwidth
- Entrenched REST API with ballooning complexity
- Decouple FE and BE development
- Business perspective

---

## GraphQL the Ruby Way
- The `graphql-ruby` gem
  - Existing implementation
  - New class-based implementation
- Basic setup in a Rails app
- Strategies for introducing GraphQL to existing REST APIs
